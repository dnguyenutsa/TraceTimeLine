TraceTimeLine is a Java tool developed with the goal of displaying the log history of a project under development. 
Using a zoom-able interface, the tool aims to provide a more robust environment for developers to get an overview of the development of a project under different view levels and sort modes.
The tool is implemented on the Piccolo2D framework which can be found at:
